## The Insurance Customer Journey Demo

This application demonstrates a complete, end-to-end insurance journey, transforming reactive processes into proactive, personalized engagements. The narrative is structured into a series of interconnected scenes.

### Scene 0: The First Click - Real-Time Anonymous Personalization

* **Objective:** Showcase real-time personalization and anonymous profiling from the very first interaction.
* **Flow:**
  1.  An anonymous visitor, **Leo**, lands on the generic Cortexa Insurance homepage.
  2.  Leo shows interest in a specific product by navigating through "Auto Insurance" to "Electric Vehicle Coverage".
  3.  The platform instantly tags his anonymous profile with an interest in EVs, and the HCL DX portal dynamically updates the hero visual and content to be EV-specific in real-time.

### Scene 1: Architecting the Proactive Strategy

* **Objective:** Demonstrate how business goals are translated into an intelligent, automated journey before any customer interaction occurs.
* **Flow:**
  1.  A regional manager, **Mark**, views a pre-configured journey in HCL Unica.
  2.  The journey's logic is clear: if an existing auto policyholder has a high-risk event (e.g., a third claim in a year), the system will automatically present them with a contextual "Life Insurance Pivot" offer.

### Scene 2: The Incident - AI-Powered Claims

* **Objective:** Showcase a seamless, AI-driven customer experience for a common insurance event.
* **Flow:**
  1.  An existing customer, **Kate**, logs into the Cortexa portal on her mobile device to file a claim.
  2.  She uses the AI-Powered Visual Damage Assessment tool, which uses her phone's camera to provide a repair estimate in seconds.
  3.  Behind the scenes, the claim submission instantly updates her profile in the Customer Data Platform (CDP), triggering the high-risk event flag.

### Scene 3: The Automated Pivot

* **Objective:** Demonstrate the platform's real-time reaction and AI-driven intelligence from a business perspective.
* **Flow:**
  1.  Mark, the manager, sees an AI Co-Pilot notification on his HCL DX dashboard: "Kate's profile now matches the 'Life Insurance Pivot' journey criteria. An offer has been made.".
  2.  The view clearly shows that the journey from Scene 1 was automatically triggered by the real-time data from the CDP.

### Scene 4: The Empathetic Cross-Sell & Transaction

* **Objective:** Close the loop with a seamless, contextual, and embedded transaction immediately following the claim.
* **Flow:**
  1.  In Kate's portal, a personalized banner with the life insurance offer appears alongside her claim confirmation.
  2.  A single click opens an embedded, pre-filled checkout flow directly within the portal‚Äîno redirects or new logins required.
  3.  The quote and payment are finalized in one session, and the new policy is immediately written back to her profile. The process is auto-approved without human input.

### Scene 5: Measuring the Impact

* **Objective:** Provide tangible proof of the journey's ROI by connecting the strategy to business value.
* **Flow:**
  1.  Mark reviews his dashboard, which shows the live, aggregated results of the completed journey.
  2.  Key KPIs are displayed, such as a +10 point uplift in NPS, a 7% conversion rate on the life insurance offer, and a 40% reduction in claim completion time.

### Scene 6: Continuous Customer Nurturing

* **Objective:** Demonstrate continuous engagement post-claim and cross-sell to reduce risk and build loyalty.
* **Flow:**
  1.  Kate is presented with personalized content, like driver's education, to help improve her driving skills and lower her long-term risk.
  2.  She is also shown relevant offers, such as a heart rate monitor or GPS tracking device, that support her new life and auto policies.
