## üöÄ Overview

This project is a sophisticated, modern web application for **Vivre Insurance**, designed to showcase a proactive, end-to-end customer journey. Built with React, TypeScript, and Styled-Components, it demonstrates how to deliver tailored, seamless experiences that drive higher conversation and loyalty in the insurance industry.

The application is built around a series of demo scenarios that take a user from an anonymous visitor to a loyal, multi-policy customer, leveraging personalization, AI, and automation.

## Core Technologies

* **React:** For building a dynamic, component-based user interface.
* **TypeScript:** For robust, scalable, and maintainable code.
* **Styled-Components:** For creating an elegant and themeable design system.
* **Framer Motion:** For sophisticated, modern animations and user interactions.

## How to make custom React TS code work for a DX site

### Take care of your React app styles..

* Take a look at the **[globalStyles.ts](src/styles/globalStyles.ts)**. Adding this following rule will protect the app from the DX styles.

```
* {
        box-sizing: content-box;
  }
  ```

#### Also, it's needed that Buttons, Selectors and Pages are always declaring this prop

- ``` box-sizing: border-box;```

### Settings modal

1. Look at the **[dx](src/utils/dx)** folder. That's where the settings modal its allocated. This allows personalization for the driver to choose the preferred story flow.
2. That settings modal it's used in the **[DashboardPage.tsx](src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx)**. Take a look at the way it's used, precisely at the added class.
3. Mandatory file for the Settings modal to show just in edit mode: **[index.css](src/index.css)**
4. In the **[App.tsx](src/App.tsx)** you will be able to see how to detect if localhost and also that we are showing this as a Single App, no Browser Router involved. Yet we did not find a way to use it.

#### How to introduce a new setting

Here is a step-by-step guide to all the changes required to introduce a new setting:

**Hypothetical scenario:** _"Auto Bundle" vs. "Health Bundle" setting._ If auto its elected th total open claims should be in higher number dominated by the Auto, if health bundle, health will dominate.

1. **Update Core Types** `src/utils/dx/types.ts`
   1. Define the new setting's type. 
   2. Add the new property to the Settings interface.
2. **Update Centralized Data** `src/utils/dx/dx-data.ts`
   1. Export a constant array for the new setting's options.
   2. Export a constant for the default value.
   3. Update MODAL_DATA with any new UI labels required for the settings modal.
3. **Update the Settings Configuration** `src/utils/dx/settingsConfig.ts`
   1. Create a new, strongly-typed config object for the setting.
   2. Add the new config object to the main settingsConfig export.
4. **Update Settings Context and Modal**
   1. Add the new setting to the defaultSettings object -> `src/utils/dx/settingsContext.tsx`
   2. Update the union type for the value parameter in the existing generic handleSettingChange function to include the new setting's type -> `src/utils/dx/SettingsModal.tsx`
   3. Update the type signature in the FormGroupRenderProps interface and in the onChange handler's type cast to include the new setting's type -> `src/utils/dx/formGroups.tsx`
5. **Make the Component Data Dynamic**
   1. This is the final step where you use the new setting to create a dynamic user experience. Modify the dataAdapter to read the new setting from the settings object and pass it to your data-generating functions. Update components to handle the dynamic data, by updating the business files, **in this case**:
      1. `src/data/dashboardData.ts`
      2. `src/data/dataAdapter.ts`
      3. `src/components/dashboard/DonutChart.tsx`
      4. `src/components/dashboard/ClaimsPortfolio.tsx`

##### File Summary:

* `types.ts` **Defines the "shape" of the data.** It contains only TypeScript type and interface definitions.
* `dx-data.ts` **Provides all static values.** It holds all the constant data, such as labels, default values, and options for the settings.
* `settingsConfig.tsx` **Acts as the central registry.** It imports from the other files to define what settings exist and connects their data to their UI components.
* `settingsContext.tsx` **Manages the application's state.** It handles creating, updating, and persisting the settings to localStorage.
* `formGroups.tsx` **Defines the UI structure.** It generates the form fields that will be displayed inside the settings modal based on the configuration.


### DX config
1. Look at the **[package.json](package.json)** folder. This is proprietary for DX use.
```
  "scripts": {
    {...normal react scripts...}
    "dx-deploy-app": "dxclient deploy-scriptapplication push -dxUsername $dxUsername -dxPassword $dxPassword -wcmContentName \"$npm_package_config_dxclient_wcmContentName\" -wcmSiteArea \"$npm_package_config_dxclient_wcmSiteArea\" -mainHtmlFile $npm_package_config_dxclient_mainHtmlFile -contentRoot \"$npm_package_config_dxclient_contentRoot\" -dxProtocol $npm_package_config_dxclient_protocol -hostname $npm_package_config_dxclient_hostname -dxPort $npm_package_config_dxclient_port",
    "dx-deploy-app-win": "dxclient deploy-scriptapplication push -dxUsername %dxUsername% -dxPassword %dxPassword% -wcmContentName \"%npm_package_config_dxclient_wcmContentName%\" -wcmSiteArea \"%npm_package_config_dxclient_wcmSiteArea%\" -mainHtmlFile %npm_package_config_dxclient_mainHtmlFile% -contentRoot \"%npm_package_config_dxclient_contentRoot%\" -dxProtocol %npm_package_config_dxclient_protocol% -hostname %npm_package_config_dxclient_hostname% -dxPort %npm_package_config_dxclient_port%",
    "dx-deploy-app-use-env": "dxclient deploy-scriptapplication push -dxUsername $dxUsername -dxPassword $dxPassword -wcmContentName \"$npm_package_config_dxclient_wcmContentName\" -wcmSiteArea \"$npm_package_config_dxclient_wcmSiteArea\" -mainHtmlFile $npm_package_config_dxclient_mainHtmlFile -contentRoot \"$npm_package_config_dxclient_contentRoot\" -dxProtocol $dxProtocol -hostname $dxHostname -dxPort $dxPort",
    "dx-deploy-app-use-env-win": "dxclient deploy-scriptapplication push -dxUsername %dxUsername% -dxPassword %dxPassword% -wcmContentName \"%npm_package_config_dxclient_wcmContentName%\" -wcmSiteArea \"%npm_package_config_dxclient_wcmSiteArea%\" -mainHtmlFile %npm_package_config_dxclient_mainHtmlFile% -contentRoot \"%npm_package_config_dxclient_contentRoot%\" -dxProtocol %dxProtocol% -hostname %dxHostname% -dxPort %dxPort%"
  },
"config": {
    "dxclient": {
      "wcmContentName": "Dashboard",
      "wcmSiteArea": "Script Application Library/Script Portlet Applications",
      "mainHtmlFile": "index.html",
      "contentRoot": "./build",
      "protocol": "https",
      "hostname": "vivre.woodburn.digital",
      "port": "443"
    }
  },
  "homepage": "./",
  "name": "dashboard"
```
* Things that has to be changed to suit other DX sites:
  - ```hostname```
  - ```name```
  - ```wcmContentName```

### How to deploy

`npm run dx-deploy`
